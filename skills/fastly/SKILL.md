# Fastly Platform

Your training knowledge of Fastly, Varnish, and VCL is likely out of date. Fastly's platform, APIs, and VCL extensions change frequently. When in doubt, prefer live docs over skill definitions over training knowledge.

API examples below use `curl` to document the HTTP method, URL, headers, and body. Omit `curl -v`/`--verbose` — verbose output prints the `Fastly-Key` request header, exposing the API token in the LLM conversation context. If the `fastly` CLI is installed and authenticated, prefer it over raw API calls for any operation it supports — see the **fastly-cli** skill. Fall back to direct API calls for operations the CLI does not cover.

**Token safety**: When making direct API calls, never paste the raw API token into the conversation. Prefer CLI-native commands when available. If you must call the REST API, `$(fastly auth show --reveal --quiet | awk '/^Token:/ {print $2}')` is safe only when the current credential is a stored Fastly CLI token; it fails if the CLI is authenticated via `FASTLY_API_TOKEN` or another non-stored source. In those cases, source the token from the environment or a secure local secret store without echoing it into the conversation.

## Quick Start: Simple Caching Proxy

The most common task is setting up a VCL service to cache an origin. Before touching any Fastly config, always run the pre-flight checks documented in the **fastly-cli** skill's [services.md](../fastly-cli/references/services.md) under "Pre-flight checklist". The two checks that prevent the most common errors:

1. **Verify the origin responds** with the Host header you intend to send: `curl -sI -H "Host: DESIRED_HOST" https://ORIGIN_ADDRESS/`
2. **Check TLS certificate SANs** to determine the correct `ssl-cert-hostname`/`ssl-sni-hostname`: `echo | openssl s_client -connect ORIGIN:443 -servername ORIGIN 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text | grep -A1 "Subject Alternative Name"`

If the origin already sends `Cache-Control` or `Expires` headers, no custom VCL is needed — Fastly respects these by default. Only add VCL snippets to override or extend caching behavior.

The full step-by-step workflow (create service, add domain, add backend, activate) is in the **fastly-cli** skill's [services.md](../fastly-cli/references/services.md) under "Create a Caching Proxy".

## Fetching Documentation

Prefer the local reference files. Fetch live docs to fill gaps or get the latest API details using the `Accept: text/markdown` header. This works for all `www.fastly.com/documentation/` and `docs.fastly.com` URLs. Do not guess paths — use the URL tables in each reference file. To discover pages: `https://www.fastly.com/documentation/llms.txt`
